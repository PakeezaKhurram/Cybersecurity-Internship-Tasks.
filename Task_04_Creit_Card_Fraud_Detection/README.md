# Task 4: Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Project Overview
This project uses Machine Learning to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Since fraud is rare, the project focuses on accurately detecting the "Class 1" (Fraud) cases while minimizing false alarms.

## Steps Taken
* **Data Cleaning:** Removed missing values and irrelevant columns.
* **Feature Scaling:** Normalized the 'Amount' column to ensure the model treats all data fairly.
* **Modeling:** Used a **Random Forest Classifier** to train the "brain" of the detector.
* **Evaluation:** Used a Classification Report to measure Precision and Recall.

## Results
The model successfully identifies fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.
